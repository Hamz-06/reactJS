Classes in react 
-> With classes we can use a constructor

-> We need to extend react component

class Clock extends React.Component {
    //render -> clock can also use a constructor we pass in props for this 
    constructor(props){
        super(props)
    } 

  render() {
      /return html div 
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
        <h2>It is {this.props.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
